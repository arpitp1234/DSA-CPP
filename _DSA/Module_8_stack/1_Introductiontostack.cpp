/*
A stack is defined as a list (a linear data structure ) in which all the insertion and deletion are made at one end called as top of stack(TOS)

Stack is data type which work on the concept last in first out

The two very important operation in stack are:- 

Push(operation)
Pop(deletion)


The most accessible information in stack is at the top of the stack and the least accessible information is at the bottom

  Example:- i) Stack of plates on a counter of cafteria;
            ii)Stack of book

Recursion are function which call itself again and again

Recursion internally uses stack

Recursion me system stack hota hai and jab iteration ki bat kare toh waha par programmer ko stack create karna padta hai


If you have know procedure in Recursion you want to convert it in iteration then you may require stack and vice versa

Abstract data type of stack

Data
1)Space for storing element
2)Top pointer

Operation

1)Push(x):- Inserting element inside the stack
2)Pop():-Removing the element
3)Peek(index):-Looking value at a given postion from the top;
4)StackTop():- knowing what is top most value of the stack
5)isEmpty:-knowing whether stack is empty
6)isFull:-knowing whether stack is full
