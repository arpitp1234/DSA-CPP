/*1.....Introduction to Data Structure*/
/*Data structure:- Data structure can be defined as arrangement of collection of data items so that they can be utilised efficiently and opeartion on data can be done efficiently*/
                /*Data Structure=Organised Data + Allowed Operation*/


/*2.Categorization of Data Structure*/

    /*i)....Linear and Non Linear Data Structure*/
   /*1)Linear Data Structure*/
      /*In linear data structure procession for data item in not possible in linear fashion i.e data can be process one by one sequentially*/
   /*2)Non linear Data Structure*/
      /*A data structure in which insertion and deletion is not possible in a linear fashion is called non linear data structure*/
  
    /*ii)....Physical and Logical Data Structure*/
       /*Physical Data Structure:-  */
        /*i)Array*/
        /*ii)Linked List*/
     /*Logical Data Structure*/
        /*
             linear--->{ 1.)Stack
                         2.)Queue
                         }
             non linear-->{
                            1.Trees
                            2.Graph
                            3.Hash Table
                            }

/*3)Abstract Data Type in Data Structure*/
      /*Abstract Data Type:- An abstract data type in a data structure is a kind of data structure whose behaviour is define wiht help of some attribute and function*/

/*4)Memory Organisation*/
       /*The software  is installed in HDD when we want to use that sofware ,then the software is brought in  Main memory where it is process with CPU central Processing Unit*/

       /*Our memory is divided into three parts:- i)Heap
                                                  ii)Stack
                                                  iii)Code Section*/                    
/*5)Static and Dynamic Memory Allocation*/
               /*Inside Stack:-Static memory allocation
                 Inside Heap:-Dynamic memory allcation */

       /*Memory which is allocated  at compile time:- Static Memory allocation*/
       /*Memory which is allocated  at run time->Dynamic Memory allocation*/
